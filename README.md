# qa-command-tool
A tool to help QA engineer to save the time on adjusting the test command
## Motivation
Human is the most creative species in this world. Not only we can output trillions of the things, but also we can input millions of the things to a software. As a QA engineer, they have to test those input to see what's going on. That's one of the major works of QA engineer. Every time, after software engineers release new features, QA engineers have to go through every corner case that customers can input. This takes tons of time and most of the time are repeated work. So I would like to build a tool that can help QA engineer to config the tests, and then automaticly run them through terminal.
